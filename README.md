__VAE_et README.md__

This module synthesizes tweets and singular emails - that is, emails which do not belong to a corpus of similar emails, either by author or subject. Tweets by nature are always considered singular.



Setup:


* install python 3.X (current latest 3.8.X) - see 
  https://www.python.org/downloads/ - simply click download button and follow defaults for installation
  
  
  
* clone the repo

* The main synthesis software is vaeet.py which creates variations on emails and tweets in /db by substitution of synonyms. Resulting email and/or tweet variations are written to /db_.  Secondary python modules are in /src. 
  Supplementary applications to prepare emails and tweets for variation are in /parsemail and /parsetweets. These directories contain json-emails and csv-tweets and modules parse.py which write them to /db as text-files as expected by vaeet.py.

  

* install dependencies - either in virtual environment  (see documentation python module venv) or else globally:

  root> pip install -r requirements.txt   

  â€‹                             

* application usage:  
  
  * parsemail> py parse.py <collection-name> - reads w3c-emails_db/<collection-name>/*.txt
    (text-files containing email information (possibly empty) name:<name>, email:<email-address>, sent:<date>, subject:<subject> and the body consisting of the email message.)  

    
    
   * parsetweets> py parse.py <collection-name> - reads <collection-name>/file.csv
      (csv-file containing one or more tweets under column one labeled 'tweets'
      and consisting of rows of tweets from 2 to N.
  
      
      
  * vaeet> py vaeet.py <collection-name-in-db>  [maximum-synonym
    substitutions-per-sentence - default 5 per sentence]
    (reads all email-json-files in db/<collection-name-in-db> substitutes
    synonyms for the prescribed number of substitutions per sentence and write
    a new email-json-file to /db_.)
